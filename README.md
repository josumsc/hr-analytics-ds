# HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists

This dataset represents a use case in which a company wants to hire data scientists among participants of the courses conducted by the company itself. The company wants to identify which of the participants are really eager to change jobs, so it can focus its efforts on this set of participants and save money and work.

The dataset thus represents a conjunction of demographic, social and labour factors that push a worker to change jobs and drives attrition. By examining the data presented, and modelling a solution for the company at hand, we may be able to understand better these factors.

## Installation of the environment

You can follow up this notebook in your machine by downloading Anaconda and then running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
conda env create --file hr-analytics-ds.yml
```

This should have you prepared to run jupyter notebook in the terminal and then running the mentioned code using that familiar interface. 

Please note that I've used a M1 Mac, so the installation might suffer from some problems if you are using a different CPU architecture. In those cases do not hesitate to look up information on the official sources such as [Tensorflow](www.tensorflow.org) or [PyPi](www.pypi.org) to solve your ocasional errors during the installation.
